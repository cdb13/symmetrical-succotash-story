This is a story about Phoebe from rural Pennsylvania. Since she was little, she loved to eat and cook food. It was what made her feel comforted and by making food for others, she hoped to comfort them as well. One of Phoebe’s favorite foods was succotash. It was so unassuming, just lima beans and corn. However, she loved how easy it was to make and act as a canvas for creative modifications. Her grandmother made it hers by always boiling the corn cobs in with the beans to infuse them with their milky sweetness. Her own mother went further by adding butter and cream to the whole mixture. Phoebe’s own contribution was adding a just a little bit of bacon. One day, Phoebe was inspired to go on a quest to learn more about succotash as a traditional American food and the ways that others all over the country made their own versions. 
	Phoebe decided to travel to the dairyland of the United States to learn how people in Wisconsin made succotash. Pheobe was shocked to learn that folks in Wisconsin were not in love with succotash the way she was. They had not yet learned how to enjoy the simplicity of the dish. Though disappointed, Phoebe had not given up hope that there were others that appreciated succotash the way she did.
